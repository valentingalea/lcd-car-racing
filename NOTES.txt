* Alternate resources for different Android OS'es

the ic_menu.xml and ic_search.xml shapes utilize some features that aren't
available on OS 2.1, therefore dummy versions for them have been created;

BUT a layout-vX with X being the API level number, provides resources for
that API level and beyond! So it is necessary to create 2 folders:
layout-v7 - for OS 2.1
layout-v8 - for OS 2.2 and greater
layout simple is the default case for the other resources.
